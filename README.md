# Survive the wild
Survive the Wild is a survival adventure game where players must navigate a hostile environment, manage scarce resources, and face relentless enemies. Every decision made impacts your survival.

# Introduction
In Survive the Wild, players are thrust into a challenging world filled with dangers, from harsh weather conditions to unyielding enemies. With limited resources, players must strategically gather loot, optimize their inventory, and master both combat and exploration. The game's dynamic weather, day/night cycle, and procedurally generated maps create a constantly evolving environment, where survival depends on smart decision-making and adaptability.

# Gameplay
Players must balance combat, resource gathering, and exploration to survive in a hostile world. Loot from enemies can be stored in the inventory or chests, and stackable items help optimize survival strategies. Dynamic elements like weather changes, the day/night cycle, and ever-changing maps keep players on their toes, forcing them to adapt. Every decision in the game, from how you fight to how you manage resources, will determine whether you survive or fall to the wilderness.
