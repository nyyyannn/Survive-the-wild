# Survive the wild
Survive the wild is a survival adventure game that challenges players to navigate a hostile environment, managing limited resources and overcoming relentless enemies. With a robust
inventory system, players can gather loot from fallen enemies and stack essential items to optimize survival strategies. The gameâ€™s dynamic elements, including a random weather system, a day/night cycle, and procedurally generated maps, create a constantly shifting world filled with both opportunities and threats. Players must balance combat, resource collection, and exploration, while using a working chest to store valuable items and track player stats. Offering a mix of ranged combat and deep customization, Endure immerses players in a relentless struggle for survival where every decision impacts their fate.
